# Quizzical App Project - React Course by Bob Ziroll from scrimba
Just a quiz app based on [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) providing an interface to select the number of questions, category and difficulty of the question; Playing the game (which is timed by the way); Displaying the score of the person and saving it in the leaderboards.
Leaderboard is located in `window.localStorage` (if any, *bummer!* :man_facepalming:).
